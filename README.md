# To-Do

1.  What you want to achieve (specific goal)

- [x] Write abstract
  - [x] State a problem 1-2 sentences. 
  - [x] Solution. 
  - [] Contribution, compared to other protocols what we've achieved.
- [] Proposals
  - [] Merchant is trusted, simple Monero payment. In case of dispute, proof the payment. No shipping included.
  - [] Merchant is trusted, funds are locked in some kind of smart contract (do we need turing-completeness?). In case of dispute, proof the payment. No shipping included.
- [] Future work
  - [] Anonymous delivery - smart contract system.
  - [] Agreement over smart contract - anonymous smart contract platform needed.
  - [] Disputes to legal authorities - we have to proof our identity anyway.
  - [] Disputes over smart contract - Themis resolution, or other reputation based system.
- [] State of the art show differences between standard TTP and blockchain based solutions.
- [] Propose experiments that validate proposed solution.
- [] Review papers
  - [x] Themis
  - [x] A Solution for Secure Certified Electronic Mail Using Blockchain as aSecure Message Board
  - [x] Lelantos: A Blockchain-based Anonymous Physical Delivery System
  - [] An efficient privacy-preserving credit score system based on noninteractive zero-knowledge proof
- [] Possible group Physical Delivery Systems, and fair-exchange systems
- [] Review anonymous blockchains
  - [] Anonymous smart contracts platforms
  - [] Aleo
  - [] AZTEC
  - [] zkSync
  - [] etc.

2.  Why does it matter to you personally? What difference will it make if you can be creative? Why do you care? How can you improve youself? How can you help others?
	- I learn how to conduct reasearch alone, I will write complete publication alone.
	- I earn a lot of points that will bring me closer to the PhD title.
  - I learn about confidential smart contracts
	- I learn how to design safe and anonymous protocols.
	- I help others that would benefit in anonymous services.
	- I help others to understand how blockchain removes the need of trusted third party in different contexts.
