\newcommand\ABSTRACT{
Lawyers, laboratories, auditors or banks, in order to provide services, require data often containing sensitive personal information.

Examples of sensitive services are genetic tests, parenthood tests, STD tests, credit score computation or legal advice. 

The processing of personal data, especially when providing services involving sensitive data like health records, biological materials, or legal documents, exposes both users and service providers (SP) to privacy risks.

SPs are at risk of violating GDPR, CPAA, and other legal regulations, while customers are at risk of losing their privacy.

We observe that personal data is often only used for logistical purposes, such as payments or communication, and could be provided anonymously if such methods were available.

We propose a solution that allows the provision of services without the collection of personal data. We use anonymous payment methods such as cash and anonymous cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology to achieve fairness, and distributed content-addressable storage networks to deliver results.

Compared to other solutions, our protocol achieves anonymity with weaker assumptions, supports physical materials and conflict resolution, and in conflict-free transactions does not require the customer to interact with the blockchain, demonstrating better practicality.

In this work, we analyse the fairness of our protocol and implement it using Ethereum technology as a message board, Monero as an anonymous payment method, and Powergate (IPFS and Filecoin) as a decentralised storage network.
