  abstract = {Real world physical shopping offers customers the privilege of maintaining their privacy by giving them the option of using cash, and thus providing no personal information such as their names and home addresses. On the contrary, electronic shopping mandates the use of all sorts of personally identifiable information for both billing and shipping purposes. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have created a stimulated growth in private billing by enabling pseudonymous payments. However, the anonymous delivery of the purchased physical goods is still an open research problem. In this work, we present a blockchain-based physical delivery system called Lelantos1 that within a realistic threat model, offers customer anonymity, fair exchange and merchant-customer unlinkability. Our system is inspired by the onion routing techniques which are used to achieve anonymous message delivery. Additionally, Lelantos relies on the decentralization and pseudonymity of the blockchain to enable pseudonymity that is hard to compromise, and the distributed consensus mechanisms provided by smart contracts to enforce fair irrefutable transactions between distrustful contractual parties.},

  abstract = {An argument system for NP is a proof system that allows efficient verification of NP statements, given proofs produced by an untrusted yet computationally-bounded prover. Such a system is non-interactive and publicly-verifiable if, after a trusted party publishes a proving key and a verification key, anyone can use the proving key to generate non-interactive proofs for adaptively-chosen NP statements, and proofs can be verified by anyone by using the verification key. We present an implementation of a publicly-verifiable non-interactive argument system for NP. The system, moreover, is a zero-knowledge proof-of-knowledge. It directly proves correct executions of programs on TinyRAM, a random-access machine tailored for efficient verification of nondeterministic computations. Given a programand time bound T, the system allows for proving correct execution of, on any input, for up to T steps, after a one-time setup requiringcryptographic operations. An honest prover requirescryptographic operations to generate such a proof, while proof verification can be performed with onlycryptographic operations. This system can be used to prove the correct execution of C programs, using our TinyRAM port of the GCC compiler. This yields a zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) for program executions in the preprocessing model -- a powerful solution for delegating NP computations, with several features not achieved by previously-implemented primitives. Our approach builds on recent theoretical progress in the area. We present efficiency improvements and implementations of two main ingredients: * Given a C program, we produce a circuit whose satisfiability encodes the correctness of execution of the program. Leveraging nondeterminism, the generated circuit's size is merely quasilinear in the size of the computation. In particular, we efficiently handle arbitrary and data-dependent loops, control flow, and memory accesses. This is in contrast with existing ``circuit generators'', which in the general case produce circuits of quadratic size. * Given a linear PCP for verifying satisfiability of circuits, we produce a corresponding SNARK. We construct such a linear PCP (which, moreover, is zero-knowledge and very efficient) by building on and improving on recent work on quadratic arithmetic programs.Revised for clarity, especially Section 3 and Appendix E.},

While payments are conducted between pseudonyms, Bit coin cannot offer strong privacy guarantees: payment transactions are recorded in a public decentralized ledger, from which much information can be deduced. Zero coin (Miers et al., IEEE S\&P 2013) tackles some of these privacy issues by unlinking transactions from the payment's origin. Yet, it still reveals payments' destinations and amounts, and is limited in functionality. In this paper, we construct a full-fledged ledger-based digital currency with strong privacy guarantees. Our results leverage recent advances in zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs). First, we formulate and construct decentralized anonymous payment schemes (DAP schemes). A DAP scheme enables users to directly pay each other privately: the corresponding transaction hides the payment's origin, destination, and transferred amount. We provide formal definitions and proofs of the construction's security. Second, we build Zero cash, a practical instantiation of our DAP scheme construction. In Zero cash, transactions are less than 1 kB and take under 6 ms to verify - orders of magnitude more efficient than the less-anonymous Zero coin and competitive with plain Bit coin.},

The customer may not want to reveal sensitive data of his identity (as credit card number, information about customer's bank, customer's account number) so that this information can not be used by merchant in commercial purpose to build spending habits of the customer. Also, a merchant may want to remain anonymous. For example, a merchant who has business in many areas may want that his customers can not link transactions where the merchant is involved in all these areas. In our previous work [4], a fair exchange e-commerce protocol for complex transactions in that a customer wants to buy several different physical products from different merchants is proposed. This solution provides customer anonymity, non-repudiation, integrity and confidentiality of data exchanged between the parties. In this paper, we extend the solution from [4] obtaining both anonymity of customer and each merchant, while preserving all properties obtained in [4].},

  abstract = {We propose Bulletproofs, a new non-interactive zero-knowledge proof protocol with very short proofs and without a trusted setup; the proof size is only logarithmic in the witness size. Bulletproofs are especially well suited for efficient range proofs on committed values: they enable proving that a committed value is in a range using only 2 log\_2(n)+9 group and field elements, where n is the bit length of the range. Proof generation and verification times are linear in n. Bulletproofs greatly improve on the linear (in n) sized range proofs in existing proposals for confidential transactions in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, Bulletproofs supports aggregation of range proofs, so that a party can prove that m commitments lie in a given range by providing only an additive O(log(m)) group elements over the length of a single proof. To aggregate proofs from multiple parties, we enable the parties to generate a single proof without revealing their inputs to each other via a simple multi-party computation (MPC) protocol for constructing Bulletproofs. This MPC protocol uses either a constant number of rounds and linear communication, or a logarithmic number of rounds and logarithmic communication. We show that verification time, while asymptotically linear, is very efficient in practice. The marginal cost of batch verifying 32 aggregated range proofs is less than the cost of verifying 32 ECDSA signatures. Bulletproofs build on the techniques of Bootle et al. (EUROCRYPT 2016). Beyond range proofs, Bulletproofs provide short zero-knowledge proofs for general arithmetic circuits while only relying on the discrete logarithm assumption and without requiring a trusted setup. We discuss many applications that would benefit from Bulletproofs, primarily in the area of cryptocurrencies. The efficiency of Bulletproofs is particularly well suited for the distributed and trustless nature of blockchains. The full version of this article is available on ePrint.},

According to the characteristics of IPFS, we propose an improved P2P file system scheme based on IPFS and Blockchain. We address the high-throughput problem for individual users in IPFS by introducing the role of content service providers. Consider data reliability and availability, storage overhead and other issues for service providers, we provide a novel zigzag-based storage model to improve the block storage model that IPFS provides. Moreover, we introduce blockchain to combine IPFS with this storage model. According to analysis, this proposed scheme can effectively solve the above problems.},

Widening applications of teleprocessing have given rise to a need for new types of cryptographic systems, which minimize the need for secure key distribution channels and supply the equivalent of a written signature. This paper suggests ways to solve these currently open problems. It also discusses how the theories of communication and computation are beginning to provide the tools to solve cryptographic problems of long standing.},

  abstract = {Advances in data collection, storage, and processing in e-Health systems have recently increased the importance and popularity of data mining in the health care field. However, the high sensitivity of the handled and shared data, brings a high risk of information disclosure and exposure. It is therefore important to hide sensitive relationships by modifying the shared data. This major information security threat has, therefore, mandated the requirement of hiding/securing sensitive relationships of shared data. As a large number of data mining activities that attempt to identify interesting patterns from databases depend on locating frequent item sets, further investigation of frequent item sets requires privacy-preserving techniques. To solve many difficult combinatorial problems, such as data distribution problem, exact and heuristic algorithms have been used. Exact algorithms are studied and considered optimal for such problems, however they suffer scalability bottleneck, as they are limited to medium-sized instances only. Heuristic algorithms, on the other hand, are scalable, however, they perform poor on security and privacy preservation. This paper proposes a novel heuristic approach based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) for enhancing security and privacy preservation of sensitive e-Health information using itemset hiding techniques. Our approach, named FACHS (FCA Hiding Sensitive-itemsets) uses constraints to minimise side effects and asymmetry between the original database and the clean database (minimal distortion on the database). Moreover, our approach does not require frequent itemset extraction before the masking process. This gives the proposed approach an advantage in terms of total availability. We tested our FCAHS heuristic on various reference datasets. Extensive experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed masking approach and the time efficiency of itemset extraction, making it very promising for e-Health sensitive data security and privacy.},

  abstract = {With the widespread of E-commerce, the need of a trusted system to ensure the delivery of traded items is crucial. Current proof of delivery (PoD) systems lacks transparency, traceability, and credibility. These systems are mostly centralized and rely on trusted third parties (TTPs) to complete the delivery between sellers and buyers. TTPs can be costly, a single point of failure, and subject to hacking, privacy evasion, and compromise. The blockchain is an immutable, trusted, and decentralized ledger with logs and events that can be used for transparency, traceability, and tracking. In this paper, we present a solution and a general framework using the popular permissionless Ethereum blockchain to create a trusted, decentralized PoD system that ensures accountability, auditability, and integrity. The solution uses Ethereum smart contracts to prove the delivery of a shipped item between a seller and a buyer irrespective of the number of intermediate transporters needed. In our proposed solution, all participating entities are incentivized to act honestly by using a double deposit collateral. Automated payment in ether is an integral part of a solution to ensure that every entity gets its intended share of ether upon successful delivery. An arbitration mechanism is also incorporated if a dispute arises during the shipping process. In this paper, we show how we implemented, verified, and tested the proper functionality of our PoD solution. We also provide security analysis and give estimates of the cost consumption in ether gas. We made the full code of the Ethereum smart contracts publicly available at Github.},

Timely and accurate testing is paramount to an effective response to this pandemic as it helps identify infections and therefore mitigate (isolate/cure) them. In this paper, we investigate this challenge and contribute by presenting a blockchain-based solution that incorporates self-sovereign identity, re-encryption proxies, and decentralized storage, such as the interplanetary file systems (IPFS). Our solution implements digital medical passports (DMP) and immunity certificates for COVID-19 test-takers. We present smart contracts based on the Ethereum blockchain written and tested successfully to maintain a digital medical identity for test-takers that help in a prompt trusted response directly by the relevant medical authorities. We reduce the response time of the medical facilities, alleviate the spread of false information by using immutable trusted blockchain, and curb the spread of the disease through DMP. We present a detailed description of the system design, development, and evaluation (cost and security analysis) for the proposed solution. Since our code leverages the use of the on-chain events, the cost of our design is almost negligible. We have made our smart contract codes publicly available on Github.},

In this paper, we propose a decentralized PoD solution for PoD of digital assets.

Ethereum smart contracts are used to orchestrate and govern all interactions and transactions including automatic payments in Ether cryptocurrency between customers, digital-content provider, and the file server hosting the digital content. All entities are incentivized to act honestly, and our solution has a mechanism to handle dispute if arisen among participants. The solution has an off-chain secure download phase involving the file server and customers. Moreover, our solution leverages the benefits of interplanetary file system to store the agreed upon terms and conditions between the smart contract actors. A security analysis of our proposed system has been provided. The full code of the smart contract has been publicly made available on Github.},

A further analysis was carried out to determine to what extent existing PPDM/PPDSM methods address the trade-off between data mining accuracy and data privacy which is a significant concern in the area. The systematic literature review was conducted using data extracted from 104 primary studies from 5 reputed databases. The scope of the study was defined using three research questions and adequate inclusion and exclusion criteria. According to the results of our study, we divided existing PPDM methods into four categories: perturbation, non-perturbation, secure multi-party computation, and combinations of PPDM methods. These methods have different strengths and weaknesses concerning the accuracy, privacy, time consumption, and more. Data stream mining must face additional challenges such as high volume, high speed, and computational complexity. The techniques proposed for PPDSM are less in number than the PPDM. We categorized PPDSM techniques into three categories (perturbation, non-perturbation, and other). Most PPDM methods can be applied to classification, followed by clustering and association rule mining. It was observed that numerous studies have identified and discussed the accuracy-privacy trade-off. However, there is a lack of studies providing solutions to the issue, especially in PPDSM.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Data mining (DM) and machine learning (ML) applications in medical diagnostic systems are budding. Data privacy is essential in these systems as healthcare data are highly sensitive. The proposed work first discusses various privacy and security challenges in these systems. To address these next, we discuss different privacy-preserving (PP) computation techniques in the context of DM and ML for secure data evaluation and processing. The state-of-the-art applications of these systems in healthcare are analyzed at various stages such as data collection, data publication, data distribution, and output phases regarding PPDM and input, model, training, and output phases in the context of PPML. Furthermore, PP federated learning is also discussed. Finally, we present open challenges in these systems and future research directions.

  abstract = {In a research community, data sharing is an essential step to gain maximum knowledge from the prior work. Existing data sharing platforms depend on trusted third party (TTP). Due to the involvement of TTP, such systems lack trust, transparency, security, and immutability. To overcome these issues, this paper proposed a blockchain-based secure data sharing platform by leveraging the benefits of interplanetary file system (IPFS). A meta data is uploaded to IPFS server by owner and then divided into n secret shares. The proposed scheme achieves security and access control by executing the access roles written in smart contract by owner. Users are first authenticated through RSA signatures and then submit the requested amount as a price of digital content. After the successful delivery of data, the user is encouraged to register the reviews about data. These reviews are validated through Watson analyzer to filter out the fake reviews. The customers registering valid reviews are given incentives. In this way, maximum reviews are submitted against every file. In this scenario, decentralized storage, Ethereum blockchain, encryption, and incentive mechanism are combined. To implement the proposed scenario, smart contracts are written in solidity and deployed on local Ethereum test network. The proposed scheme achieves transparency, security, access control, authenticity of owner, and quality of data. In simulation results, an analysis is performed on gas consumption and actual cost required in terms of USD, so that a good price estimate can be done while deploying the implemented scenario in real set-up. Moreover, computational time for different encryption schemes are plotted to represent the performance of implemented scheme, which is shamir secret sharing (SSS). Results show that SSS shows the least computational time as compared to advanced encryption standard (AES) 128 and 256.},

  abstract = {Supply chains are evolving into automated and highly complex networks and are becoming an important source of potential benefits in the modern world. At the same time, consumers are now more interested in food product quality. However, it is challenging to track the provenance of data and maintain its traceability throughout the supply chain network. The traditional supply chains are centralized and they depend on a third party for trading. These centralized systems lack transparency, accountability and auditability. In our proposed solution, we have presented a complete solution for blockchain-based Agriculture and Food (Agri-Food) supply chain. It leverages the key features of blockchain and smart contracts, deployed over ethereum blockchain network. Although blockchain provides immutability of data and records in the network, it still fails to solve some major problems in supply chain management like credibility of the involved entities, accountability of the trading process and traceability of the products. Therefore, there is a need of a reliable system that ensures traceability, trust and delivery mechanism in Agri-Food supply chain. In the proposed system, all transactions are written to blockchain which ultimately uploads the data to Interplanetary File Storage System (IPFS). The storage system returns a hash of the data which is stored on blockchain and ensures efficient, secure and reliable solution. Our system provides smart contracts along with their algorithms to show interaction of entities in the system. Furthermore, simulations and evaluation of smart contracts along with the security and vulnerability analyses are also presented in this work.},

  abstract = {To date, many important threads of information privacy research have developed, but these threads have not been woven together into a cohesive fabric. This paper provides an interdisciplinary review of privacy-related research in order to enable a more cohesive treatment. With a sample of 320 privacy articles and 128 books and book sections, we classify previous literature in two ways: (1) using an ethics-based nomenclature of normative, purely descriptive, and empirically descriptive, and (2) based on their level of analysis: individual, group, organizational, and societal. Based upon our analyses via these two classification approaches, we identify three major areas in which previous research contributions reside: the conceptualization of information privacy, the relationship between information privacy and other constructs, and the contextual nature of these relationships. As we consider these major areas, we draw three overarching conclusions. First, there are many theoretical developments in the body of normative and purely descriptive studies that have not been addressed in empirical research on privacy. Rigorous studies that either trace processes associated with, or test implied assertions from, these value-laden arguments could add great value. Second, some of the levels of analysis have received less attention in certain contexts than have others in the research to date. Future empirical studies \textemdash{} both positivist and interpretive \textemdash{} could profitably be targeted to these under-researched levels of analysis. Third, positivist empirical studies will add the greatest value if they focus on antecedents to privacy concerns and on actual outcomes. In that light, we recommend that researchers be alert to an overarching macro model that we term APCO (Antecedents \textrightarrow{} Privacy Concerns \textrightarrow{} Outcomes).}

  abstract = {With the rapid development of electronic information technology, online transaction will gradually surpass traditional market transaction, among which online payment and asset delivery become the focus of attention. But in fact, due to the incomplete third-party payment mechanism and the intrusion risk of various charging Trojan, it is easy to cause a trust crisis. The existing centralized framework often leads to information asymmetry between the two parties. Therefore, how to realize the fairness of payment and the auditability of assets in the distributed system is a challenging problem. The emerging blockchain technology provides a new method with its openness, transparency and verifiability. Existing researches do not provide a complete shopping model for consumers, most of which focuses on payments or only on asset delivery. In this paper, we propose an auditable fair payment and physical asset delivery protocol based on smart contracts. Three types of smart contracts are designed to achieve reliable and fair payment among merchants, consumers and logistics companies. The traceability and auditability of blockchain provide an effective method to audit assets and data sharing in the whole transportation. In view of the phenomenon of goods being switched, the way of ''pre-verification'' is added. In order to prevent the illegal elements to fake pickup code, induce consumers to conduct illegal operations, cause property loss, in our system the pickup codes are generated by consumers to reduce the risk of fraud. In addition, our plan designs a complete return process for the first time, providing better service experience and higher efficiency for consumers. Finally, all the contracts involved in the scheme are implemented and deployed on the ethereum test network. The results of security analysis and evaluation showed that our scheme was improved in cost, with high security and availability.},
