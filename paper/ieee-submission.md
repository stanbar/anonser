# Justification

The manuscript I have submitted is a research article that presents a novel solution for anonymous service provision using blockchain technology and decentralized storage networks. The manuscript contains original research based on theoretical analysis and experimental validation, which makes it suitable for the research article manuscript type. The article aims to contribute to the advancement of the field by proposing a new protocol for service providers to offer sensitive services without collecting personal data. Moreover, the manuscript presents a comparison of the proposed protocol with existing solutions, which provides insights into the strengths and limitations of different approaches.

# Scope

This article addresses an interdisciplinary issue of anonymous service provisions like anonymous medical tests or anonymous law advice. It proposes a practical protocol for solving the problem using current advances in decentralized technologies, namely blockchains, anonymous cryptocurrencies, and content-addressable storage networks. As some of the state-of-the-art protocols included in our article have been published in IEEE Access, we consider IEEE Access a natural choice for this work as well.

# Unique Contribution

The proposed protocol is a novel solution for anonymous service provision. It is based on the combination of blockchain technology, decentralized storage networks, and anonymous payment methods achieving anonymity, fairness, dispute resolution, TTP-less, physical materials delivery, practicality and availability of the results. The protocol is compared with existing solutions, which provides insights into the strengths and limitations of different approaches.  

Moreover, in the manuscript we systemise often misused definitions of anonymity, pseudonymity, linkability, and traceability; propose a framework for analyzing fairness in fair-exchange protocols; discuss the possible improvements with the use of secure computation, self-sovereign identities, and blockchain-based dispute resolution.
